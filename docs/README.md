# Lazy4J

A generic Lazy class in java

## What is it?

A small container class that takes a lambda and evaluates it at most once,
but not before the result is needed.

## Why?

This is often recurring functionality that should have been provided out of the box by the JDK
when lambda's were introduced in Java 8.

Fortunately, it's not very difficult to create, so that's what we did.
